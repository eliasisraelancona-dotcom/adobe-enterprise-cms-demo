Subject: Q&A Workflow added to Adobe Enterprise CMS demo

Hi [VP Name],

We’ve extended the Adobe Enterprise CMS demo with a lightweight Q&A workflow designed for live sessions:

- Capture audience questions during the presentation
- Provide an answer immediately or defer and resolve later
- Track status (Open, Answered, Deferred) with automatic timestamps

Highlights
- Seamless Admin UI experience: new Questions list with create/edit and an optional triage page
- Simple governance today; permission hooks ready for enterprise RBAC
- Extensible to brands, content, or assets for contextual Q&A

Why it matters
- Demonstrates Cursor’s ability to safely add data models and UI in minutes, not days
- Reinforces our approach of “slow, subtle, but secure” enhancements
- Shows practical value to stakeholders evaluating real adoption workflows

Demo path
- Admin UI → Questions (or sidebar link “Questions”)
- Create a question; add/modify answers anytime; update status to "Answered" when ready

Next
- If useful, we can tie questions to specific sessions/brands and add notifications for answer completion.

Best,
[Your Name]
